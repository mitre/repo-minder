{"id":"repo-minder-8lv","title":"PROJECT OVERVIEW: Repo Minder Modernization","description":"## Project Context\n\n**What:** Modernize repo-minder (license standardization tool) to 2025 Python standards and add multi-file community health support.\n\n**Current State:** v1.0.0 - Working tool that standardizes LICENSE.md across 240+ MITRE SAF repos with 69 passing tests.\n\n**Goal:** Bring to modern standards, add docs/release automation, enable multi-file support (SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Key Documents\n- MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md - Complete implementation plan (500+ lines)\n- PYTHON_PROJECT_SETUP_GUIDE.md - 2025 Python standards reference\n- SESSION01.md - v1.0.0 development history\n- ROADMAP.md - Future features (v1.1.0+)\n\n## Epic Structure (4 Epics, ~22-32 hours)\n\n**Epic 1: Modernize to 2025 Python Standards (repo-minder-hxh)** - FOUNDATION\n- Remove black, use ruff-only\n- Python 3.12+ requirement\n- Pre-commit hooks\n- Modern CI workflow\n- Dependencies: NONE (start here!)\n\n**Epic 2: Documentation Infrastructure (repo-minder-rpb)** - PARALLEL\n- MkDocs with Material theme\n- GitHub Pages deployment\n- User and developer guides\n- Dependencies: Epic 1 complete\n\n**Epic 3: Release \u0026 Publishing Automation (repo-minder-3r0)** - PARALLEL\n- python-semantic-release\n- PyPI trusted publisher\n- Automated CHANGELOG.md\n- Dependencies: Epic 1 complete\n\n**Epic 4: Community Health \u0026 Multi-File Support (repo-minder-bn7)** - DOG-FOOD\n- Create SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md templates\n- Extend CLI to support multiple file types\n- Use repo-minder on itself!\n- Dependencies: Epic 1, 2, 3 complete\n\n**Epic 5: Future Features (repo-minder-vcn)** - v1.1.0+\n- Full multi-file support (all tech stacks)\n- Template preview, fork management, policy enforcement\n- Dependencies: Epic 4 complete\n\n## Template Variables Extracted\n\nFrom analyzing mitre/vulcan, mitre/heimdall2, mitre/train-k8s-container:\n\n**Existing:** organization, team, case_number, copyright_org, copyright_year, org_office, org_address, org_phone\n\n**New:** team_email (saf@mitre.org), security_email (saf-security@mitre.org), project_name, project_description\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **LICENSE.md is unified** - Combines Apache 2.0 + NOTICE content in one file (no separate NOTICE.md)\n2. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md is 100% identical** across all MITRE repos (Contributor Covenant v2.1)\n3. **CHANGELOG.md is auto-generated** by release-please (not templated by us)\n4. **External templates use ChoiceLoader** - Jinja2 ecosystem standard pattern\n\n## Work Order\n\n1. Start with Epic 1 (Foundation) - ALL tasks unblocked\n2. Epic 2 \u0026 3 can be done in parallel after Epic 1\n3. Epic 4 requires all previous epics complete\n4. Epic 5 is future work (post v1.1.0)\n\n## Quick Start Commands\n\n```bash\n# See what's ready to work on\nbd ready\n\n# Show full task list\nbd list\n\n# Start working on a task\nbd comment repo-minder-hxh.1 'Starting work on this'\n\n# Mark task done\nbd close repo-minder-hxh.1\n\n# See epic dependencies\nbd show repo-minder-hxh\n```\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- All 4 epics complete\n- 2025 Python standards compliant\n- Documentation deployed to GitHub Pages\n- Automated releases to PyPI\n- Community health files generated using repo-minder itself\n- Ready for v1.1.0 release with multi-file support\n\n## Timeline\n\nTarget: 4-6 working days (~22-32 hours total)\n\nLast updated: 2026-01-01","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-01T12:02:56.41759-05:00","created_by":"alippold","updated_at":"2026-01-01T12:04:29.310561-05:00","comments":[{"id":2,"issue_id":"repo-minder-8lv","author":"alippold","text":"This is a reference overview.
